# Huffman Algorithm
In this project, we implement the Huffman Coding algorithm.

Huffman Algorithm is a data compression technique that assigns variable-length binary codes to input symbols based on their frequencies. Symbols that occur more frequently are given shorter codes, while less frequent symbols are assigned longer codes. This results in an efficient encoding that minimizes the overall size of the data.
